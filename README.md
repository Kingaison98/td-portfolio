A collection of production/pipeline tools to demonstrate experience.

## FoxBearShotgun

The FoxBearShotgun project was a set of tools I began developing for my senior thesis in the fall of 2019. It was meant to enhance production workflow and create less work for artists by creating a standalone app for them to check and update progress on tasks outside of the Shotgun browser service, as well as process and upload new playblasts from Maya to Shotgun. Due to the nature of the production changing over time, we ended up not using Shotgun as much and thus the only part of the tool that remained completed was the standalone app.


## BatchExporter

This was a tool I developed quickly during Greg Richardson's Tech Art course, which allows the user to attach animations to a rig and export new scenes as a batch.
